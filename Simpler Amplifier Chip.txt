>Simpler Amplifier Chip:

Recommended Chip: TDA7266 Dual Bridge Audio Amplifier
Reasoning: The TDA7266 is a dual bridge audio amplifier chip capable of delivering up to 7 watts per channel (at 8 ohms) or 12 watts in bridge mode. It is designed for easy integration into compact audio systems and offers a simplified pin configuration compared to more advanced amplifier chips. The TDA7266 requires minimal external components for operation, making it suitable for simpler PCB designs. It operates on a wide voltage range (typically 4.5V to 18V) and features built-in short-circuit and thermal protection.
Using the TDA7266 amplifier chip allows you to achieve decent power output for your pocket-sized speaker project while simplifying the PCB design with fewer pins to manage. Make sure to refer to the chip's datasheet for detailed specifications and application guidelines when designing your PCB.
